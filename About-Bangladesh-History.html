	<br>
	<br>


	<div>
		<p class="bd_history_text">In 1905 the British divided what they called Bengal into two – with Dhaka as capital of the east and Calcutta of the west. But they met with such fierce resistance led by, amongst others, the great Bangla poet Rabindranath Tagore – that they had to reunite the province in 1912. By 1946 it was clear to the British that they were going to have to quit India – and that a united India was going to be impossible to preserve. Bengal's Muslim League Chief Minister, Hussein Shaheed Suhrawardy, agreed with local Hindu leader Sarat Chandra Bose to claim an independent united Bengal. Instead when partition came in 1947 it was on the basis of religion, not language. The eastern part of Bengal thus became East Pakistan while the west remained part of India – though the Chittagong Hill Tracts went to East Pakistan.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>



		<div class="bd_history_text">
			<p>The government of Pakistan dominated largely by the west — declared Urdu as the only official language of the entire Pakistan which
		triggered a massive dissatisfaction among the people of the east. On 21 February, 1952, Bengali students in East Pakistan rose up forthe mother tongue and protested against this decision. As police open fired to their possession, several students died for defending their language.
		The glorified sacrifice of these martyrs is now observed not only in Bangladesh but also all over the world as <strong>International Mother Language Day</strong>.</p>
